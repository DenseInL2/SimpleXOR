# SimpleXOR

Dead-simple example of a 2-3-1 feedforward neural network solving the XOR truth table. Created for an example on /r/MLQuestions

X: The network inputs
Y: The target output (the XOR truth table)

Variables called W are weights, B are biases, S are node input sums, A are the node activated outputs, deltas are backprop errors, dW and dB are the accumulated batch update changes to weights and biases.
